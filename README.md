### SCD Type 1 Implementation Using Pandas
This project demonstrates how to implement Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 1 using the Pandas library in Python. SCD Type 1 involves overwriting old data with new data in a dimension table, ensuring that the table always reflects the most current information.

- Read the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
- Identify the columns to be updated
- Update the DataFrame with new data
- New data to be merged
- Merge the new data with the existing DataFrame
- Save the updated DataFrame: After updating the DataFrame, you can save it back to a CSV file or any other format you prefer.

## SQL Integration
In this project, all SQL operations such as creating tables, adding new items, and managing the dataset are also implemented using Python. This ensures that the project is self-contained and provides a comprehensive understanding of SCD Type 1.
